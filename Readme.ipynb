And the GPU offered by colab pro is Tesla T4/P100 GPU ).\n","\n","The project folder can be accessed publicly through the following link:\n","[Project Folder Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QCCQNiR2HwddjqQmZWER8z_PyrFf_E5x?usp=sharing)\n","* Here is the address in case the link above does not work:\n","  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QCCQNiR2HwddjqQmZWER8z_PyrFf_E5x?usp=sharing\n","\n","The code can be ran locally with following library setup:\n","* Note: to run it in local, make sure pytorch CUDA is enabled in the local environment.\n","```python\n","python==3.7.10\n","torch==1.8.1+cu101\n","torchsummary==1.5.1\n","torchvision==0.9.1+cu101\n","matplotlib==3.2.2\n","numpy==1.19.5\n","sklearn==0.0\n","sklearn-pandas==1.8.0\n","seaborn==0.11.1\n","pandas==1.1.5\n","```\n","\n","## Requirment for Folder Structure\n","\n","To run the code properly, the following folder structure needs to be maintained:\n","\n","```python\n",".\n","├── model_output # This folder contains all of progress performance metrics and trained model for the main project code \n","├── cropped_img # This is cropped image which is generated by CroppingAnnotatedImg.py\n","│   └── without_mask\n","│   └── with_mask\n","│   └── mask_weared_incorrectly\n","├── CIFAR_10_Testing # This folder will keep the cache for CIFAR_10 testing data for faster training\n","│   ├── cifar-10-batches-py\n","├── CIFAR_10 # This folder will keep the cache for CIFAR_10 training data for faster training\n","│   ├── cifar-10-batches-py\n","├── MIE424_ProjectCode.ipynb # Main Project Code\n","├── CroppingAnnotatedImg.zip # This folder contains code to generate cropped image for the Kaggle face mask dataset which is not required to run the main project code.\n","```\n","\n","## Usage\n","The main project contains the following sections which can be ran in order:\n","1. Data Loader (Define general data loader)\n","2. Model Building (LeNet 5)\n","3. Training Code (Helper functions for training output, plotting curves and save progress)\n","4. Hyperparameter Tuning (To determine the base hyperparameter setup)\n","5. Loss Function (Our loss function implementation)\n","6. Model Training (The actual model training for face mask data)\n","7.

Because running through command line might not be able to see all of visualization properly):\n","  ```python\n","  Ctrl + Shift + F10 #use this command in the pycharm to run all\n","  ``` \n","  * Through command line:\n","  ```python\n","  python3 mie424_projectcode.py\n","  ```"]}]}
